        <h1>Hobbies and Personal Interests</h1>
        <h3>Pokemon Go</h3>
        <p>Although I have been playing on and off since the launch of the game in 2016, only recently have I started playing the game daily. Since I walk around so much in college, and the campus itself has plenty of small statues or landmarks, Pokemon Go was a great time to not only pass time in walking between classes, but to play with friends I made as well. Additionally, I sometimes like to stroll in the park near my apartment to play while also getting some well needed Vitamin D. <a href="https://pokemongo.com/events">Pokemon Go</a></p>

        <h3>Box Stitching</h3>
        <p>My brag about box stitching is that most people cannot start the stitch but I can, and have been able to since elementary school. I learned how to first do the craft in a summer camp and have remembered since. In fact, there is some plastic lanyard string at my apartment that I can use to weave a new stitch whenever I want to pass time or just make something. The repetitive motions are not only calming, but create an end product that can also be a gift to others. <a href="https://guides.brit.co/guides/make-a-squarebox-lanyard">Box Stitch Starter Guide</a></p>

        <h3>Eating</h3>
        <p>Like most other people in the world, I love to eat and try new dishes. I have my favorite cuisines like Chinese, Mexican, and Italian, but there are also so many cuisines that I still have not tried much if any dishes at all. I am quite curious about Slavic food like their pierogies and borscht, and their stuffed cabbages look delicious as well. Additionally, I do not want to just eat from restaurants, but hopefully learn how to cook a couple meals for myself too. Currently, my goal is to work on bettering my skills at folding dumplings and baos, but I wish to expand my culinary skillset further than boiling water and noodles.</p>
        <h3>Unpopular Opinions</h3>

            <li>Donuts are disgusting, especially when a glaze is added on top.</li>
            <li>It's acceptable to hate on something just because it is popular.</li>
            <li>Fanfiction is sometimes better than actual books.</li>
