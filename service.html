                    <h2><strong>Past Volunteering</strong></h3>
                    <h3>Senior Homes</h3>
                    <p>Mostly during high school and junior high, I went to different senior homes volunteering. This typically consisted of playing music to the residents as I played the flute all throughout middle school, junior high, and high school. In high school, some friends and I founded Music: The Cure, a volunteer group aimed at improving the quality of life and interacting with the senior residents in nursing homes through music, with a focus on those with memory-related illnesses. Musical activities included solo performances, organized group performances, and caroling. Outside of music, there were other non-musical volunteering opportunities in the nursing homes, like crafts or holding an Easter egg hunt. <a href="https://cantexcc.com/snf/the-colonnades-at-reflection-bay/">Nursing Home</a></p>
                    <h3>TAMU Build</h3>
                    <p>During my freshman year, I volunteered for Build through a cultural organization. Build was started after the bonfire incident in 1999, which would lead to the tragic loss of Aggies on a special day. In honor of that tragedy, the organization helps build medical clinics using shipping containers, providing access to clinics in healthcare deserts and underprivileged areas. The volunteering varies, but typically involves working with tools and teams to help construct the clinics. Though sometimes the labor may be tough, the cause and goals stem from a genuine desire to help those in need while remembering the lives lost in 1999.

                    <h2><strong>Future Volunteering</strong></h3>
                    <h3>Animal Shelters</h3>
                    <p>I have always loved animals growing up and enjoyed interacting with them. If you were to ask me if I were a dog or a cat person, I would immediately say I am a dog person, not to say that I do not like cats, as I also adore them. As such, I would love to volunteer at an animal shelter or an organization that works with pets to help our furry companions. Given the credentials of the vet school at Texas A&M, there are also plenty of organizations that work with animals. One specific organization that I found is the Aggieland Humane Society, which typically works with local animal shelters to help provide loving pets with their future homes.

                    <h3>Teaching</h3>
                    <p>The summer after my senior year of high school, I worked part-time at a local summer camp as an assistant teacher, helping to teach the campers math, English, science, and Chinese. The overall atmosphere was very relaxed, and I had a great time interacting with the kids. As such, I am considering possibly volunteering with Aggies Promoting Literacy, an organization that helps elementary school students develop their reading comprehension skills. Activities include book clubs, read-alongs, and more. Not only will this help out the Bryan-College Station community, but I find that I quite enjoy working with kids, many of whom are always full of energy and humor.
